Move + New Task button to the right of the "Active Tasks" label of Active Task List
Move delete task option into task item
TaskListControls will now only contain "Sort By" select and label
Add header to the left that says either "Tasks" or the Project Name.


New Task View Layout
-----------------------------
[ HEADER ]        [ SORT BY ]

[ ACTIVE TASKS ]  [ + NEW T ]
[ TASK 1 ////////////////// ]
...
[ TASK N ////////////////// ]

[ COMPLETED TASKS ]
[ TASK 1 ////////////////// ]
...
[ TASK N ////////////////// ]
-----------------------------


Also need to do a similar layout for projects
When all tasks of a project are completed, it is marked as complete and "moves" to the
completed project list
